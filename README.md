# scikitbook
Repo for my Scikit Learn Book [Code + Book]

# Running the code

I suggest you create a conda environment first,
then install the required libs there:

```
conda create -n scikitbook python=3.6
conda activate scikitbook
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

You need to do the above steps once.
Then to activate the environment:

```
conda activate scikitbook
```

And to run Jupyter:

```
jupyter notebook
```
